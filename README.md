# Snake-Game

## 🐙 Project Description:
Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic and addictive arcade-style experience right at your fingertips. I've meticulously crafted this game from the ground up, where you take control of a snake on a mission to gobble up food and grow, all while avoiding collisions with the walls and your own ever-lengthening tail. This project is not only a great way to relive the nostalgia of this timeless game but also serves as a fantastic introduction to game development for those looking to dive into the world of coding. The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify for your own unique features or improvements. From adjustable speed settings to different difficulty levels, you have the power to customize the game to suit your preferences. So, whether you're a coding enthusiast, a game aficionado, or just looking for a little retro fun, explore the code, experiment with enhancements, and enjoy countless hours of Snake Game entertainment!
