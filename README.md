# Snake-Game

## 🐙 Project Description:
Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic and addictive arcade-style experience right at your fingertips. I've meticulously crafted this game from the ground up, where you take control of a snake on a mission to gobble up food and grow, all while avoiding collisions with the walls and your own ever-lengthening tail. This project is not only a great way to relive the nostalgia of this timeless game but also serves as a fantastic introduction to game development for those looking to dive into the world of coding. Whether you're a coding enthusiast, a game aficionado, or just looking for a little retro fun, explore the code, experiment with enhancements, and enjoy the fun experience! Wahoo!
